This is the repository for a Windows application that allows to modify decrypted saves of commercial video games.

If you use Windows 7 SP1 or Windows 8.1, you just need [.NET Framework 4.7.2](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/thank-you/net472-web-installer) to make it work.

## User guide

### How to use it for PS4 games

You need first to get a decrypted save. There are two ways to achieve it:

1) [Playstation 4 Save Mounter](https://github.com/ChendoChap/Playstation-4-Save-Mounter): If you have a PS4 with a HEN or Custom Firmware, you may want to use [this free and fast tool](https://github.com/ChendoChap/Playstation-4-Save-Mounter)

2) [Save Wizard](https://www.savewizard.net/): If you do not have a custom firmware, you can obtain a copy of a decrypted save and re-encrypt it using [the following paid software](https://www.savewizard.net/)

Once you get your save, just open it using Kingdom Save Editor from File\Open, then save it with File\Save. If you want to transfer back the file on your Playstation 4, just follow the guide lines of the tool that you used for decryption

## How to use it for PS3 games

Decrypt your PS3 save game using the software `BruteForce Savedata` and modify the save from the KH3SaveEditor. Once you completed your changes, you need to save and encrypt the save back. It would be ideal to implement an encrypt/decrypt feature in the editor and it will come at some point.
If you use an emulator such as `RPCS3` you can skip this step as `RPCS3` does not encrypt save data

### How to use it for PS2 games

The editor works on the raw save data from PS2 save game files. As long as you can extract the save slot from the memory card or from your favourite emulator, you can edit it. PCSX2 saves are supported as long as a memory card is converted as a Folder.

### Build guide

The project is structured into libraries and GUI. Libraries are written in .Net Core and they are cross-platform (eg. Linux and MacOS are supported). Although, the GUI is heavily depentant from Windows and you need Visual Studio 2019 or later.

When you clone this repository, remember to launch the script `setup.bat` if you are on Windows or `setup.sh` if you are on Linux, to set-up the minimum requirements to build the project.

The script `pack.bat` uses WinRAR's self-extracting archive to create a single executable file ready to be distributed.

## License

The code itself, the interface and the codes inside it are protected by GPL 3.0 license, unless specified differently in the root of a specific folder. In short, that means that for every change you made or code that you take from here, you need to make it open source somewhere, adding the original copyright statement and specify where the original code has been taken.

If you have more doubts about the GPL license, have a read to the following links:

## Privacy

The application will have full access to the file you will open by using "File\Open" in order to be able to modify your save game data and it will send the version of the save editor to provide customized messages at the home page to suggest which changes you will find in a new release.

It is important to state that it does not collect any information if not asked for the explicit authorization of it. The source code can be found on GitHub, so you can have an idea on which data the application have access to.
